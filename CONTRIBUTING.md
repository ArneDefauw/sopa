## Pull Requests

To add some new code to **sopa**, you should:

1. Install the dependencies.
2. Create your personal branch from `dev`.
3. Make sure you read the coding guidelines below.
4. Implement your changes.
5. Create a pull request on `dev` with explanations about your developed features. Then, wait for discussion and validation of your pull request.

## Coding guidelines

- Use the `black` formatter and `isort`. Their usage should be automatic as they are in the `pyproject.toml` file. Depending on your IDE, you can choose to format your code on save.
- Follow the [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide.
- Provide meaningful names to all your variables and functions.
- Document your functions and type your function inputs/outputs.
- Try as much as possible to follow the same coding style as the rest of the repository.
